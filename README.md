# 2048-AI
an AI that plays 2048

dependent on the pygame module

this project is my solo work, without referencing code from any other similar project

## Preformance:
the AI can either see 1,2,3 moves ahead. A tree is contructed and then passed through an evaluation algorithm to deduct the 'optimum' move

by seeing 1 move ahead, ai can generally reach 256,128

by seeing 2 moves ahead, ai can generally reach 1024 half of the time, and below that for the other turns

by seeing 3 moves ahead, ai can generally each 2048 1/5 of the time, and almost allways reaching 1024
